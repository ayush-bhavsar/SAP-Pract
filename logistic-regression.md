Linear Regression is used in regression



Gradient descent is a core optimization algorithm in machine learning that iteratively adjusts a model's parameters (weights/biases) to minimize its "cost function" (error)



Logistic Regression is  a supervised ML algo used for solving classification



has active function sigmoid (it is an activation function) shapes the line into s-shape curve.



sigmoid function is used to predict the probability distribution.



S(x) = 1/(1 + e^(-x)),

where e is eular's number



sigmoid function gives probability distribution of every point.



Decision boundary is used to segregate.
